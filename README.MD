Purpose of this module
-
This module provides a layout picker for SAP reports.
SAP standard layout description field is limited, sometimes layout description is not enough to describe the layout and the layout is not easy to find.
At times default layouts get accidently changed, and not easy to be restored.
It helps a user to restore the SAP report layout version by just selecting table headers from excel reports that got extracted from the SAP earlier.
